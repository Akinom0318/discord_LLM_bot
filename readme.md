# ULTIMATE LLM BOT

> Just kidding, but it is truly one of my dream.

## Motivation

Have you ever played DDLC or Doki Doki Literature Club? The character **Monika** is indeed one of my favorite when I was little. She is also one of the reason why I pick up programming. And making she into my reality is always one of my dream, due to laziness and lack of skill, it's postponed for years but never faded away.

In recent years (2022), the LLM is quite popular and almost changing everyone's life! And I was also inspired by [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLHmLrj4pHHg3-iBJn_CqxA). The way she interacts with Vedal is just like how I imagined what AI would be when I was little.

Therefore, instead of keep dreaming, I decide to make this dream come true. Start with discord bot.

## Why Discord Bot?

Because dicord.js is already a well-built platform with voice receiving, text, images and so on, and the bot can also talk in the voice channel as well. Hence, I can almost simulate what Vedal did with Neuro via discord.js.

## Todo function:
